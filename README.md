Tool: Python (selenium webdriver, pandas)

I faced some problems running the code, as the click function was not working properly. But after running it for the second time it ran perfectly well.
I was unable to open each page to gather more data (especially the data in pdf). But I’m sure given some time I’ll find some way around it too.

Thank You
